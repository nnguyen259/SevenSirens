# Welcome to the start of the logic for S7SR
# This is a comment, use hashtags anytime you want to say something that isn't meant to be interpreted as code
# Areas are indicated on the map by different colours, and everything within is grouped together
# Anchors are locations within the game, usually at crossroads or places with lots of pickups
# Pickups are the tasty loot we're looking for, list any skills needed to obtain it
# Connections let the logic move from one location to another, listing any skills needed
# Connections are always one-way, there will be another connection going from the second anchor to the first, with possibly different skills needed
# Standard is our first logic difficulty, there may be more to come
# Resources: Nugget and Gem costs are written as 5n or 100g respectively
# Skills: Newt, Drill, Tortoise, Frog, Octo, Seer, Refresh, Shock, Quake
# skills should be separated by commas, order does not matter, however, ORs should always be at the end of the line
# ORs should only handle one skill, if a combination of skills is needed instead, use a new line
# We will handle potential damage boosts later, for now assume you can either get through any enemies damageless with only hair whip, or have enough food to tank it
# For short poison water swims, note how much damage it takes, if possible
